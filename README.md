This is a simple XSS vulnerability scanner that detects Cross-Site Scripting by replacing values in form fields and modifying URL parameters. It monitors the page for reflections of the Payload and helping to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities easily.



1) Run the Vulnerability_scanner.py and Change the url in the file to your testing address.
2) If Some Library is not install(e.g., rich in py) then can manually install it.
